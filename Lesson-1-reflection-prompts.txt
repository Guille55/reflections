How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Fill in your answer here: 
    allows to directly point out the lines of code that are different between
    the 2 versions, and probably there will be the error, probably a typo.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Fill in your answer here:
    probably allows me to find the correct version I'm looking for right away,
    or navigate through them to find bugs or use a previous working state of 
    that file/program.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Fill in your answer here
    It allows to the user intelligently choose the point to create a new commit.
    Every new commit must reflect a logical change to the prgram, the changes
    shouldn't be too small or too big.
    Automatically saved changes are not appropiate because they wont be done auto-
    matically without any reflecting any logical change.
    

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Fill in your answer here
    Because you need all the files that form a program in that specific state for
    the commit (snapshot), that is forming a repository as a cohesive unit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Fill in your answer here
    You need to be in the directory of the program (master) and type 'git log' to
    see all the history of commits.
    Using 'git diff [ID1] [ID2]' allows you to compare to commits (watching the 
    deletions & insertions).
    Using 'git config --global color.ui auto' allows to see the insertions '+' in
    green, and the deletion '-' in red.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Fill in your answer here
    Because I know I can return to any previous working commit, using 
    git checkout [ID]

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Fill in your answer here
    Everything, but I wanna know how to actually implement the commits
    and all the Git functionality in a new webpage I build.
