when would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    when you want to create a project where many can colaborate online and make it public & open-souce.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because Git can't know when a logical change has effectively been done, rather than saving e.g. every 5 minutes with no logical changes
    been done or maybe more than one but half-way through other.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    Fork is tocy a repository in GitHub to a repository on mine directly on GitHub.
    Clone allows to copy a repository from GitHub to my local machine or vice-versa.
    A branch allows to add a new branch of commits locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    Allows you to watch if there are new commits/changes in the remote repository vs. your local, and also be able to use and work with those remote commits without internet.
